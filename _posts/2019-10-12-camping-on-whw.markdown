# Introduction

This post has three purposes: first, to record all the bits of camping experience I’ve picked up on the most popular Scottish hiking route. Second, to preserve the personal narrative of this 7 day journey in something more reliable than my memory. And finally, to have the undivided attention of the audience while showing my pictures of these amazing landscapes. Mixing all these goals might not work for someone from general public, but just a quick skimming can still be of value.  While writing, I tried to keep it concise and finish it as fast as possible, otherwise I would fall in the perfection trap and never complete it, and whatever it ended up being, it ended up existing. 

# Route

I had a plan to spend about a week in Scotland with my friend Alisa. We’ve both already been to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and we wanted to see the famous landscapes of Scotland, so our direction was clearly into Scottish Highlands. 

The first option I considered was renting a car or using public transport to get around a couple islands (Isle of Mule, Isle of Sky) and to spend several days on each. The second one was long distance hike for the whole week. At the time of choosing, I didn’t really feel like organizing the travel schedule, multiple transits and accommodations, and once I’ve discovered West Highland Way, it felt like an instant relief and apparent choice. 

WHW is the most popular long distance (152 km) route in Scotland, spreading from Glasgow in Lowlands to Fort William in Highlands, near UK’s tallest mountain Ben Nevis. Advertised everywhere as an easy and accessible route that you can almost walk with your toddler, it is supposed to be completed within 5-8 days, depending on experience. I chose a 7-day breakdown, and I believed we would both feel comfortable with such a relaxed version. Time has proven me and lots of the info in the Internet wrong - and here’s the story.


# Day 0. London to Glasgow

We took a 20£ train (huge luck) from London to Glasgow the day before start. Everything behind the window up to Lancaster in the North was a daunting flatness, but up from there it became interesting.

In Glasgow we stayed in the Airbnb.

# Day 1. Milngavie to Drymen
We took a train from Glasgow Central to Milngavie, the north suburb of Glasgow and the formal start of the route.

*Impeding locals from walking to not get into cameras. Bloody tourists.*

The first day was quite boring. There were very few interesting landscapes, I don’t even have a great photo to post, and we just treated this day as means to an end. We stayed on the campsite .

# Day 2. Drymen to Campsite, x km

The second day was one of the most interesting ones. The high points of the day for me was Forest and Loch Lomond views.
Half of the walk was in the forest with

Before lunch, we stopped to have a break along the way. I went deeper in the forest that seemed quite mysterious, and I was rewarded with an absolutely fairy tale views. It felt incredibly enigmatic, bright, breathing, humid, alive. I’ve seen red poisonous mushrooms for the first time in my life!

We had a picnic with the first view on Loch Lomond in a very timely manner – it started raining right after we finished.

At this point I also realized I have lost my sitting mat somewhere in the last hour of my journey. Imagine how lucky I felt when about 20 minutes after a group of guys that were passing us by carried it and asked us whether it was ours! Later in the campsite we met them again and found out they were from London riot police. What kind of riot police is that? :)

Closer to the evening, we reached Loch Lomond, the largest Scottish lake, with some stunning views.

We arrived at the campsite quite late, so we had to set up a tent in the dark. One interesting newspaper cut on the wall:

My pictures don’t really convey the full spectrum of landscapes that surrounded us at that point!

On our descent Alisa decided to have some freedom from the map and to choose an intuitive path. Though it led to a really nice area that looked like a Biblic Edem in my imagination, later on we had to break through some heavy bushery and swampy land.

Finally, we reached the shore of Loch Lomond. At this point of time, we were very tired, and the idea that water can wash away our tiredness became irresistible, so with little hesitation about the water temperature we had a swim! Concisely it can be described as a sharp and amazing feeling of being alive.

*How about some inspiration? The record time to complete WHW, 152 km, was 13 hours 37 minutes.*


# Day 3. Campsite to Campsite on the lake, x km
We woke up at about 9 am due to not setting an alarm, and it took us regular 3.5 hours from awakening till being ready to go. This included having the morning routine, breakfast, packing backpacks and the tent. The amount of time spent on these activities is quite daunting, and during the whole journey I wasn’t able to reduce it to less than 3 hours without a rush. 


We started off at about 12:30, and at the lunch break, we had the turning point of the hike - Alisa decided to quit the route due to health issues. She started having throat pain already on day 0, and the increasing physical weakness made further (quite demanding) parts of the route too hard for her. We discussed that and agreed that she would leave the next morning, and I would continue the journey until the end.
