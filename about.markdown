A man dies and gets to heaven. He meets Peter the Apostle.

P: Do you really want to know that?
M: Absolutely.
P: Do you remember when you went on a train Moscow-Kransodar in 1973?

P: And you went to the dining car together.
M: Yes...
P: And by the next table there was a woman.
M: Perhaps..
P: And she asked you to pass her some salt. 
M: And I passed her the salt.

M: Yes, I did.
P: Here you are...
